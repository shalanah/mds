Drivers of all ages should pay special attention at intersections. And a recent study has proved it again. Taking your time to approach the intersection slowly can calm a driver, but it can also mean less accidents.

A <a target="_blank" title="MPR Minneapolis Bike Car Crashes" href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2013/01/15/news/minneapolis-bike-car-crashes">recent study</a> reports that bicyclists and drivers are equally to blame for accidents due to not yielding the right-of-way, and "The vast majority of crashes occurred within 50 feet of an intersection." Minneapolis, has also been voted the "Top Bike-Friendly City" in the US. With bikes and cars sharing the road more and more, everyone needs to take their time and look, follow right-of-way, and show extra caution at the intersections.

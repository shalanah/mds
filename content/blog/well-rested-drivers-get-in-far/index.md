Getting a good night’s sleep not only makes you feel better, but it can help you avoid a car accident. Drivers are at their best when they have had at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep the night before, according to a recent report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.

### From the report, compared to drivers who got 7-8 hours of sleep a night:

- 6-7 hours had <strong>1.3 times</strong> crash rate
- 5-6 hours had <strong>1.9 times</strong> the crash rate
- 4-5 hours had <strong>4.3 times</strong> the crash rate
- Less than 4 hours had a <strong>11.5 times</strong> the crash rate.

When you are on a highway and there is a lane closure up ahead, it is best to use all lanes until you reach the closure. Do not merge early! This adds to a traffic backup and can also lead to more accidents. Each car merge can be thought of as a separate intersection. Intersections slow things down. That’s why highways are so fast in general, there are on and off ramps but no intersections. When many cars decide to merge along different points on the same lane, this creates many mini-intersections, backing up both lanes of the highway. Instead, use all lanes and merge closer to the lane closure creating just one intersection. This method looks like a zipper, and so it is called the “zipper merge”.

A few years ago, Minnesota lawmakers took a stand against belt-less drivers. For those special cases where one’s own well-being and safety isn’t a good enough reason to buckle up, now police officers are empowered to pull over Minnesota drivers for the sole purpose of issuing tickets to otherwise law-abiding drivers.

Did their belt-buckling and life-saving plan work? The short answer is yes. The long answer is yeeesssss.

A study done by the University of Minnesota shows that the new law resulted in a 68 fewer deaths and a whopping 320 fewer injuries between 2009 and 2011. That’s a lot of healthy and safe drivers that might not otherwise be on the road.

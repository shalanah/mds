According to the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/169120506.html?refer=y" target="_blank">Star Tribune</a>, pedestrian deaths in 2012 are already at a 5 year high in Minnesota. MDot has decided to launch a <a href="https://www.dot.state.mn.us/peds/education/index.html" target="_blank">“Share the Road”</a> campaign to raise awareness to this deadly, but very reversible trend.

## Here are some of their major tips:

- "Stop for pedestrians at crosswalks."
- "Watch for pedestrians at all times."
- "Avoid distracted and aggressive driving"

At Midway Driving School, we make sure all our behind-the-wheel drivers understand the importance of safety while driving. Students are trained to actively pay attention to the road without distractions.

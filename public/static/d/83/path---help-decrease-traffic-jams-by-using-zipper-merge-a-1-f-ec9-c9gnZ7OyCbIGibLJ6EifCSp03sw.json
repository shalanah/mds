This adds to a traffic backup and can also lead to more accidents. Each car merge can be thought of as a separate intersection. Intersections slow things down. That’s why highways are so fast in general, there are on and off ramps but no intersections. When many cars decide to merge along different points on the same lane, this creates many mini-intersections, backing up both lanes of the highway. Instead, use all lanes and merge closer to the lane closure creating just one intersection. This method looks like a zipper, and so it is called the “zipper merge”. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcPby71TNC0\" target=\"_blank\">MnDot Zipper Merge Video</a></li>\n<li>Read more: <a href=\"http://www.dot.state.mn.us/zippermerge/\" target=\"_blank\">MnDot Zipper Merge</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Help Decrease Traffic Jams by Using the Zipper Merge","date":"April 09, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/help-decrease-traffic-jams-by-using-zipper-merge/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/well-rested-drivers-get-in-far/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Well rested drivers get in far fewer accidents","tags":["nervous adult behind the wheel training"]}},"next":null}}

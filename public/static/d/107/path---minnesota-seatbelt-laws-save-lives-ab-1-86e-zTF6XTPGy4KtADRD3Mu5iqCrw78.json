For those special cases where one’s own well-being and safety isn’t a good enough reason to buckle up, now police officers are empowered to pull over Minnesota drivers for the sole purpose of issuing tickets to otherwise law-abiding drivers.</p>\n<p>Did their belt-buckling and life-saving plan work?

When ice is hard to see we call it “Black Ice.” This can happen when precipitation falls and freezes onto the cold pavement or a melt and freeze occurs.</p>\n<h2>Black Ice and Icy road condition tips:</h2>\n<h3>Slow down</h3>\n<p>Regardless of the speed limit, drive at a safe speed for icy roads. Go especially slow on bridges, overpasses, and tunnels. These may be icier than other parts of the road due to the air traveling above AND below the road. Also pay special attention to the road in the morning. The air warms faster than the pavement creating icier than expected road conditions.</p>\n<h3>Give your car space, and avoid braking on the ice</h3>\n<p>It is much harder to brake on ice, and ice may cause your car to skid. Make sure to give your car more room than you think you need between yourself and the vehicle in front of you. Also, turn off cruise control, so you are more actively engaged as a driver, and can give yourself more time to react and adjust as necessary.</p>\n<h3>Avoid distractions</h3>\n<p>Make sure you are ready to focus on the road with both hands on the wheel. Do not use your phone while driving. Texting while driving is both dangerous and illegal in Minnesota. </p>\n<h3>Read more about black ice from MnDOT</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dot.state.mn.us/workzone/blackice.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dot.state.mn.us/workzone/blackice.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Black Ice - Tips for driving safely on Minnesota's icy roads","date":"February 12, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/black-ice-tips-for-driving-safely-on-m/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/driving-tips-for-construction-season/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Driving Tips for Construction Season","tags":["construction","construction driving tips","defensive driving","defensive driving","driving tips","minnesota","mn","mndot","safe driving tips"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/stay-back-tips-for-driving-safely-b/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stay Back! - Tips for driving safely behind a snowplow","tags":["defensive driving","driving tips","minnesota","mn","mndot","nervous adult","nervous drivers","safe driving tips","snowplow","winter driving","winter roads"]}}}}

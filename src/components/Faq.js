    question: 'What is the best package for training a new driver?',
    answer:
      'Once you have completed your first lesson, your instructor will let you know after which package will help prepare you the best for the Road Test. In most cases, the 7½ hr package is perfect for covering everything you need to know for the Road Test.'
